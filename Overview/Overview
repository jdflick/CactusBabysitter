MAIN FUNCTIONS
• turns on/off a flourescent light daily
• turns on/off a water pump weekly
• adjusts RGB LEDs based on temperature constantly
• displays variables to an LCD screen
• increment those variables based on button pushes

The system I made was to take care of three cactuses. Regardless,
changing the code/components should allow you to take care of any
plant you'd really want to as long as you use a flourescent light
that plants can benefit from.

The parts list included is a bit vague, as I am away from the system
right now for awhile. The only parts that you'd really need to be 
identical to mine are the LCD screen and the realtime clock. I've
provided links to those in the parts list.

The wiring strategy was probably the trickiest part. The main issue
is getting power to everything. Because I don't have it here to look
at, the wiring is just a rough idea of how we did it.

The code has comments in it which should help explain it a bit. It
may not be the most effiecient code, but it worked for my setup so
I figured I'd post it. The additianal libraries you'll need are also
in the code folder. 

If you need any help or have any questions I'd be happy to assist you.
